Amenity Furniture is based on my previous ecommerce store “Project Amenity”. While implementing the same backend framework (Django), and keeping a similar frontend design to the original design, this remastered version includes some important differences, and new features. The frontend now uses React.js and Redux for state management, and React Bootstrap for styling. Unlike the original project this project includes Paypal payment processing, and uses JSON Web Tokens for user authentication.
